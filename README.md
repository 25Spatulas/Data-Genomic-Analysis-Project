# Data-Genomic-Analysis-Project
# This is a project in where differentially expressed genes between 2 different groups of people are analyzed, the 2 different groups being people that were addicted to cocaine and
#   people that were not addicted to cocaine.

# To analyze the data extracted from a Gene Expression Omnibus database, The programming language R and several libraries (affy and geoquery) are used to help create
# results that can be interpreted

# After the program in R is finished executing, the code will generate a list of genes used to input into DAVID, a database that holds information related to bioinformatics for
# many species, but DAVID will be used mainly for genes and keggways in humans. 

# After inputting the list of genes into DAVID, the screenshots provided are the results that are returned from DAVID, which are comprised of the top differently expressed genes
# and the kegg pathways that are associated with the phenotype that was analyzed.
